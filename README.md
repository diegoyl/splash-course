## Overview
Splash Course is an EdTech site for watching, creating, and commenting on educational videos.
I decided to make it ocean themed to give it some design direction.

## Instructions
I hosted this on Vercel, so you should be able to visit this link:

## Screenshots
### Landing Page
Users have to input a username for when they make commments

### Create Video
A popup where you can add info for a new video, which gets added to the User Videos tab in the Video List Page
- Note: If you are already on the user videos tab, you have to press it again to refresh the list after adding a new video

### Navbar (as seen in above images)
Contains various buttons
- Logo Button => goes back to Landing Page
- Search Bar => just a dummy, you can type stuff, but won't actually search
- Create Video Button => opens Create Video Popup
- Profile Button => just for visuals, doesn't work
